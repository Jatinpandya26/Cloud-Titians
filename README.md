# Cloud-Titians - Voice-based Web browsing app for disabled people using Cloud APIs


## Detils

Basically you need to use a Text to speech API for a Web App that can be used in a browser like Chrome or Firefox.
In this Challenge, you need to make a Text to speech App as a prototype by your own set of names and data to convert it to speech [ should be working ].
  
## Steps

Step 1 — Using the Web Speech API

The Web Speech API is broken into two major interfaces:
  
  1. SpeechSynthesis - For text-to-speech applications. This allows apps to read out their text content using the device’s speech synthesizer
   2. SpeechRecognition - For applications that require asynchronous voice recognition. This allows apps to recognize voice context from an audio input. 

Step 2 — Building the Text-to-Speech App
You will now start building our text-to-speech application.

Step 3 — Building the Main Script

Now you are down to the last piece that powers the app—the main script

Step 4 — Upload the Script and API call code on Github. [* Platform for the main script must be Digital Ocean]
